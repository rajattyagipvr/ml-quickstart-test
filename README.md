# ML-python-sklearn-nbc-cpu-service

Quickstart project for executing a wine classifier using the SciKit-Learn framework on a CPU.

Running `pip install requirements.txt` and then `python app.py` will start the app on localhost where the user can send GET requests to perform inference.

eg .../wine/{index} where index is in the range [0:178]
